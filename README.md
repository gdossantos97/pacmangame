# pacmangame

This is a simple game that has some simple javascript iterations and loops to create a quirky application that will endlessly spawn new pacman and increase
their speed as you keep pressing on the start game button 

to run this game you will need to download the files, then open up the html document inside a browser and you're all set!

This app has some interesting properties that I think will be very useful for future projects especially on the front end of web design.
